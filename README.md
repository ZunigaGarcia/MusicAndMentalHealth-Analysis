## Project Overview
This project is an analysis made over Music and Mental Health Survey (CC0: Public Domain) dataset, using Python and Tableau. The original dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results/data)
> "The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of Music Therapy or simply provide interesting sights about the mind."

This data analysis project aims not only to make statements about the findings, but also to raise further questions about the relationship between music and mental disorders, based on the responses to the survey.
### Interpreting Data:
* **Background questions:** Respondents had to answer general questions such as age, whether or not they compose music, primary streaming service they use, hours per day they listen to music, etc.
* **Music Genre:** Respondents were asked to rank how often they listen to 16 music genres, from 'Never' to 'Very Frequently'. They were also asked to identify their favorite music genre.
* **Mental health:** Four mental disorders were considered, and respondents were asked to rate from 0 to 10 how often they experience these disorders/how extreme they find these disorders to be:
  * Anxiety
  * Depression
  * Insomnia
  * OCD

  They also had to answer whether or not music therapy helps them ease their issues.

## Tools
* Python - Data exploration and cleaning
* Tableau - Data analysis and visualization
## Data Cleaning/Preparation
* Data loading and inspection
* Handling missing values by deletion
* Handling outliers by Interquartile Range 
* Handling left missing values by imputation
* Final steps and export into a clean format
## Dashboards
These can be found in the "Music And Mental Health.twb" file, which I have left along with the other sources in this repository so that you can explore and interact with them. (I do not own Tableau Server so I couldn't upload it there :( )
